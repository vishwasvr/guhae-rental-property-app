# ðŸš€ Automated CI/CD Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up automated production deployments with manual approval gates.

## Prerequisites

- âœ… Repository with quality check pipeline
- âœ… DNS and SSL certificates configured
- âœ… AWS account with deployment permissions
- âœ… GitHub repository access

## Step 1: Configure GitHub Environment Protection

### 1.1 Create Development Environment

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down and click **Environments** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New environment**
5. Enter environment name: `development`
6. Click **Configure environment**

**For Development Environment:**

- **Required Reviewers**: Leave unchecked (automatic deployment)
- **Deployment Branches**: Add branch `develop`
- **Environment URL**: Add your dev domain (e.g., `https://guhae-dev.example.com`)

### 1.2 Create Production Environment

7. Click **New environment**
8. Enter environment name: `production`
9. Click **Configure environment**

**For Production Environment (Single User):**

**Option A: No Required Reviewers (Recommended for solo development)**
- **Required Reviewers**: Leave unchecked (you can self-approve)
- **Deployment Branches**: Add branch `main`
- **Environment URL**: `https://www.guhae.com`

**Option B: Required Reviewers (For team collaboration)**
- **Required Reviewers**: Check and add team members
- **Deployment Branches**: Add branch `main`
- **Environment URL**: `https://www.guhae.com`

**Option C: Use Manual Trigger Only**
- Skip environment protection entirely
- Use `workflow_dispatch` to manually trigger deployments
- No approval required, full control

### 1.3 Save Configuration

Click **Save protection rules** to apply the settings.

## Step 2: Configure AWS Deployment Secrets

### 2.1 Create IAM User for Deployment

```bash
# Create IAM policy for deployment
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name GuhaeDeploymentPolicy \
  --policy-document file://deployment/guhae-deployment-policy.json

# Create IAM user
aws iam create-user --user-name guhae-deployment-user

# Attach policies
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name guhae-deployment-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess

aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name guhae-deployment-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID:policy/GuhaeDeploymentPolicy

# Create access keys
aws iam create-access-key --user-name guhae-deployment-user
```

### 2.2 Add Secrets to GitHub

1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Click **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**

Add these secrets:

```
Name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
Value: [Access key from step 2.1]

Name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Value: [Secret key from step 2.1]
```

## Step 3: Test the Setup

### 3.1 Manual Workflow Trigger

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Production Deployment** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select `production` environment
5. Click **Run workflow**

### 3.2 Verify Deployment

Check the workflow logs for:

- âœ… AWS credential validation
- âœ… SSL certificate detection
- âœ… CloudFormation deployment
- âœ… Lambda code update
- âœ… Website deployment
- âœ… Health checks

## Step 4: Approval Workflow

### For Future Deployments:

#### Development Environment (Automatic):

1. **Push code** to `develop` branch
2. **Quality checks** run automatically
3. **Dev deployment** runs automatically after checks pass
4. **Ready for testing** at dev URL

#### Production Environment (Manual Approval):

1. **Create PR** from `develop` to `main`
2. **Quality checks** run on PR
3. **Merge to main** after approval
4. **Manual approval** required for production deployment
5. **Production deployment** runs automatically after approval

### Approval Process:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Find the **Production Deployment** workflow run
3. Click **Review deployments**
4. Select the production environment
5. Click **Approve and deploy**

## Single-User Deployment Options

### Scenario: You're the Only Developer

As a solo developer, you have three options for production deployments:

#### **Option 1: Self-Approval (Recommended)**
- Configure production environment **without required reviewers**
- Deployments to `main` will auto-deploy after quality checks pass
- You maintain control but skip the approval step

#### **Option 2: Manual Trigger Only (Most Control)**
- Use the **"Manual Production Deployment"** workflow
- Click **"Run workflow"** in GitHub Actions
- Type `"deploy"` to confirm deployment
- No environment protection or approvals needed
- Full manual control over production deployments

### Manual Production Deployment Workflow

For complete control as a solo developer:

1. **Push code** to `main` branch (quality checks run automatically)
2. **Go to Actions** tab in GitHub
3. **Select "Manual Production Deployment"** workflow
4. **Click "Run workflow"**
5. **Type "deploy"** in the confirmation field
6. **Click "Run workflow"** to start deployment

This approach gives you:
- âœ… No approval loops
- âœ… Complete deployment control
- âœ… Can deploy anytime after quality checks
- âœ… Works perfectly for solo development

### Recommended Setup for Solo Development

1. **Development**: Automatic deployment on `develop` branch
2. **Production**: Self-approval on `main` branch (no required reviewers)
3. **Manual Override**: Use workflow dispatch for emergency deployments

### Workflow for Solo Developer

```
develop branch â”€â”€ Quality Checks â”€â”€ âœ… Auto Deploy to Dev
     â”‚
     â””â”€â”€ Create PR â”€â”€ Quality Checks â”€â”€ Self Review â”€â”€ Merge to Main
           â”‚
main branch â”€â”€ Quality Checks â”€â”€ âœ… Auto Deploy to Prod (Self-Approved)
```

This gives you fast feedback in development while maintaining production safety.

## Troubleshooting

### Environment Not Protected

- Check that environment name matches exactly: `production`
- Verify protection rules are enabled

### AWS Credential Errors

- Confirm secrets are added to repository (not environment)
- Validate IAM user has required permissions
- Check AWS region configuration

### SSL Certificate Not Found

- Ensure certificate is in `us-east-1` region
- Verify domain name matches exactly: `www.guhae.com`
- Check certificate validation status

### Deployment Fails

- Review CloudFormation stack events
- Check Lambda function logs
- Validate API Gateway configuration

## Security Best Practices

- **Rotate AWS credentials** regularly
- **Use least-privilege IAM policies**
- **Enable MFA** for GitHub accounts
- **Monitor deployment logs** regularly
- **Set up billing alerts** for AWS costs

## Cost Considerations

- **GitHub Actions**: Free for public repos, $0.008/minute for private
- **AWS Lambda**: ~$0.50/month for basic usage
- **CloudFront**: Pay-per-GB transferred
- **DynamoDB**: Pay-per-request pricing

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Configure environment protection
2. âœ… Set up AWS credentials
3. âœ… Test automated deployment
4. ðŸ”„ Add monitoring and alerts
5. ðŸ”„ Set up rollback procedures

Your automated CI/CD pipeline is now ready! Deployments to production will require manual approval while maintaining full automation of the deployment process.
